    <h1>From <i>Dark Souls</i> to <i>Sekiro</i></h1>
    <p class="date">30 May 2020</p>
    <p>
      Following the success of the <i>Dark Souls</i> serie, From Software
      released <i>Sekiro</i> in 2019. It was not a surprise that it closely
      followed the the now beloved formula of its predecessor. The similitudes
      are many: cranked up difficulty compared to mainstream releases,
      impressive bosses, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But there's also a world of difference between the two games, and I
      believe that it is there that Sekiro truly shine.
    </p>
    <h2>The Player Character</h2>
    <p>
      From the very beginning, the difference is obvious: the player is no
      longer able to create its own character but is instead incarnating the
      eponymous Sekiro. Beyond the cosmetic aspect
    </p>



    <h2>Old Stuff</h2>

    <p>
      <i>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</i> closely follows the footsteps of the
      <i>Dark Souls</i> serie, but adds its own twist to it. One of the biggest
      change to the formula is the way the player's character can be developped.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <i>Dark Souls</i>, the progression of the player's character came
      mainly from two factors: equipment (mostly found by exploring the world)
      and stats (raised by spending souls, mostly found on dead enemies). The
      various equipment pieces could also be reinforced by spending souls and
      crafting materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the overall system was easy to understand, the fact that every stats
      behaved differently and that every piece of equipment had different flaws
      and benefits and could in turn be reinforced in different way to provide
      additional effects made it difficult for the player to fully understand
      what would be the effect of each decision on the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sandbox aspect of <i>Dark Souls</i> character progression was very
      interesting, but From Software decided to go for a different, tighter
      system for <i>Sekiro</i>. While the decision to have the character
      progression be more restrained in <i>Sekiro</i> makes sense from the point
      of view of the story coherence (since you are no longer playing as an
      anonymous undead but rather as a character with a pre-established story),
      I believe it is also interesting to consider what could have triggered
      those changes from the point of view of the game design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like <i>Dark Souls, </i><i>Sekiro</i> features several layer of character
      progression, but those layers are very differents from each other. There
      are three main layers: stats increase, skill trees, and the prosthetic
      tool upgrade tree. Let's see how each of those layer fit into the overall
      design of the game.
    </p>

    <h2>Stats increase</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Sekiro</i> has an extremely simple stat system. Your character only has
      two stats: <b>Attack Power</b> (how much damage your attacks do) and
      <b>Physical Attributes</b> (how much health and posture you have). Attack
      Power is raised by one each time you kill a boss, Physical Attributes is
      raised by one each time you gather four Prayer Beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously the complexity has been reduced from the eight different stats
      in <i>Dark Souls</i>. But it should also be noted that this system has
      other consequences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The player can no longer choose which stat to raise.</li>
      <li>
        The player can no longer farm to raise stats.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Given the lack of variability of this system, it is easy for the
      developpers to roughly predict what will be the stats of the player at any
      given point in the game. This is interesting because it allows the
      developpers to tweak some values (such as boss health and posture) to be
      more precisely balanced to reflect the capabilities of the player.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is still a small progress margin available to the player. For
      example, if a player is stuck on a boss, there is always the option to
      hunt for more Prayer Beads in order to increase their health and posture.
    </p>

    <h2>Skill trees</h2>
    <p>
      Over the course of the game, the player will unlock several skill trees.
      Each skill can be unlocked for a given amount of experience, obtained by
      killing enemies. Unlike the stats system, it is harder to predict what
      skills the player will have at any point in the game: different players
      might unlock different skills, some players might decide to farm
      experience, etc.
    </p>

      <i> A skill tree in Sekiro</i>
    </div>
    <p>
      However, it is worth noting that some of the most important skills (such
      as the Mikiri Counter) are located at the beginning of the first skill
      trees the player will unlock. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a
      great majority of players will have access to the same core set of
      fundamental skills at some point early enough in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the game makes it very obvious that some skill are almost
      mandatory and should be unlocked as soon as possible. For example, toward
      the beginning of the game, the player has to scale the massive Ashina
      Castle. As the player ascends the structure using the grapling hook,
      enemies will use projectile against him. As the player will be in mid-air
      most of the time, those projectiles cannot be blocked unless the "Mid-air
      Deflection" skill is acquired. This skill will be extremely handy in the
      immediately following boss fight.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Prosthetic tool upgrade</h2>
    <p>
      The third and last mean for the player to upgrade their character is the
      prosthetic tool upgrade tree. Prosthetic tools are useful and can make
      some parts of the game easier, but they are also dispensable. As such, the
      game gives more freedom and less guidance regarding which upgrade to pick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to think of prosthetic tools as a way for the player to experiment
      with the game in a way that is reminiscent of <i>Dark Souls</i>. Some
      tools might have unexpected use (such as the Loaded Spear allowing you to
      perform a special attack on the Headless Ape boss) or might be especially
      effective against specific enemies (such as the Sabimaru being powerful
      against Okami warriors).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also worth mentioning that the rarest crafting materials are
      strictly limited in one playthrough. Therefore, different players will end
      up with different incomplete upgrade trees depending on their favorite
      tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      As you can see, each of the path used to develop the player character has
      a different goal. In contrast to <i>Dark Souls</i>, it seems like From
      Software tried to have more control on how the player would progress
      through the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stats system is a basic but effective way to soft-lock the player into
      following the "right" path, and to ensure that re-exploring early-game
      areas is easier than the first time around. Given how the combat mechanics
      work, it still allows skilled player to go off the beaten path.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skill system allows the player to be more engaged with the game, as
      you are constantly acquiring experience points, you know you will have a
      new skill as reward sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, prosthetic tools are a nice extra for players that want to
      experiment more, or that found a specific challenge too difficult and want
      to make it easier.
    </p>
    <h2>What could be improved?</h2>
    <p>
      The skill system is the weakest one in my opinion, because once you
      acquired the main passive skills, the active skills don't feel really
      useful (especially since you can only equip one at a time). It especially
      shows if you are going into NG+ and try to complete the skill tree. I
      believe it could be fixed simply by replacing some active skills by
      passive skills, which provide a bigger incentive for the player. Some
      interesting additions would have been:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Terror status is extremely dangerous (compared to the Burn and
        Poison status) and the enemies able to inflict it are annoying to fight.
        A skill increasing your resistance to Terror available in the late game
        would be nice.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Unseen Aid mechanic is very punishing and rarely feel fair. A skill
        allowing you to raise the Unseen Aid triggering chance would be a way to
        mitigate that.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The active skills could be instead found by killing mini-bosses or
      achieving other in-game challenges.
